# 350S20-9: iRally
Repository for the iRally Project.

## Technical Background
The iRally Project involved the development of an Android application, a React web app, and an associated Node Express backend to connect to a MongoDB Atlas instance for the database and Amazon S3 buckets for image storage. The Android application was written in Kotlin and Java while the React web app and Node Express server were written in Javascript. Nicolas Barra, Akhil Chandra, and Hayley Sussman, and Amelia Rosenbaum all contributed to the project.

## Motivation
Historically, young people are among the least politically-engaged demographics, but, with the rise of recent movements among this group, many adolescents and young adults are looking to become more involved with politics. Existing social media platforms can be tricky spaces to navigate when politics are involved. Young people may be wary of posting political opinions that differ from those of their friends, family, and followers, as well as of engaging with those they follow about their political opinions. For those looking for a friend to attend a rally with, or for those looking for rallies to attend in the first place, thereâ€™s space for a new social media platform to meet this need. iRally aims to help this target audience connect with like-minded individuals to find out about, organize trips to, and attend rallies, demonstrations, and protests. 

## General Feature Set
On iRally, users are be able to manage their accounts, find out about events that fit their interests, and engage with the political community easily. Organizers are be able to create administrator accounts to post the events they are planning, and users are able to see these events. Administrators can monitor the number of people who plan to attend in order to ensure sufficient space, and users can communicate with the administrators by posting on the event pages if they have questions or suggestions.
