# 350S20-9: iRally

## Background
Repository for the iRally Project. The iRally Project involved the development of an Android application, React app, and an associated Node Express backend connecting to an MongoDB Atlas instance. Nicolas Barra, Akhil Chandra, and Hayley Sussman, and Amelia Rosenbaum all contributed to the project.

## Motivation
Historically, young people are among the least politically-engaged demographics, but, with the rise of recent movements among this group, many adolescents and young adults are looking to become more involved with politics. Existing social media platforms can be tricky spaces to navigate when politics are involved. Young people may be wary of posting political opinions that differ from those of their friends, family, and followers, as well as of engaging with those they follow about their political opinions. There’s a demand of young people looking to engage with politics for the first time or of those already politically engaged who are looking to become more politically active. 
For those looking for a friend to attend a rally with, or for those looking for rallies to attend in the first place, there’s space for a new social media platform to meet this need. iRally aims to help this target audience connect with like-minded individuals to find out about, organize trips to, and attend rallies, demonstrations, and protests. 

## General Feature Set
On iRally, users will be able to manage their accounts, find out about events that fit their interests, and engage with the political community easily. Organizers will be able to create administrator accounts to post the events they are planning, and users will see these events. Administrators can monitor the number of people who plan to attend in order to ensure sufficient space, and users can communicate with the administrators by posting on the event pages if they have questions or suggestions.
